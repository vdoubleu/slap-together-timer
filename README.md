# slap-together-timer
I really wanted a rubiks cube timer that could plot my solve time on a graph. Every timer that had that option on the app store costed money. So I slapped together a timer in 15 min that had all the features I wanted. No gui, doesn't look nice, probably not the most effective or most efficient. But it works and has what I need.
